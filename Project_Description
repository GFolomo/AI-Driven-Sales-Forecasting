PROJECT SCENARIO
1.	Client Approach
A leading U.S.-based retailer/e-commerce company has approached me with a critical business challenge: accurately forecasting sales for the year 2026 using daily historical sales data from 2025. Their business experiences significant fluctuations due to seasonal trends, promotions, holidays, and external market conditions, making traditional forecasting methods unreliable.
Their goal is to:
  a)	Optimize inventory management – prevent stockouts and overstocking.
  b)	Improve demand planning – align procurement and logistics with customer demand.
  c)	Enhance financial planning – allocate budgets efficiently based on sales projections.

2.	Project Objectives
•	Develop a highly accurate time series forecasting model, optimized for the retailer’s data patterns.
•	Improve forecasting accuracy by fine-tuning key hyperparameters to capture trend shifts and seasonality effects.
•	Evaluate model performance using key metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²) 
•	Provide actionable insights through data visualization to help decision-makers interpret and leverage forecasts effectively.

3.	Methodology
  1)	Data Collection & Preprocessing:
    a.	A dataset comprising daily sales data from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025 in a csv file is provided.
    b.	Handle missing values, outliers, and seasonal effects (holidays, promotions).
  2)	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    a.	Identify sales trends, cycles, and anomalies using visualizations.
    b.	Compute statistical summaries to understand data distribution.
  3)	Model Development 
  4)	Model Optimization
    a.	Fine-tuning parameters to improve performance.
  5)	Model Evaluation
Assess improvements in error reduction, trend accuracy, and prediction stability.

Expected Business Impact
✅ Increased Sales Efficiency – Retailers can anticipate demand surges and plan promotions more effectively.
✅ Better Inventory Management – Reduces stockouts and excess inventory, saving costs.
✅ Data-Driven Decision Making – Helps finance and supply chain teams align with sales trends.

4.	Final Deliverables:
📈 Interactive Dashboard: Visualizing combined 2025 and 2026 daily sales projections.
📁 Model Code & Documentation: Reproducible codebase using Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
📊 Summary of findings: results, discussion and conclusion
