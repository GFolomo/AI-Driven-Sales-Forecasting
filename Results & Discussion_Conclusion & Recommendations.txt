1.2) Discussion & Significance
     -------------------------
a) Model Performance Metrics Comparison
Although XGBoost has lower MAE and RMSE then Prophet, its R² being close to 1.0 does not always indicate a good model. It may be overfitting.

b) Interpretation of Future Forecasting Patterns
**Prophet Model:
- The future predictions align well with past sales trends, meaning it captures seasonality and trend components effectively.
- This suggests that Prophet is incorporating external influencing factors like holidays, promotions, or business cycles. Holidays were actually incorporated.
**XGBoost Model:
- The near straight-line future predictions indicate potential overfitting to training data, failing to generalize trends properly.
- This suggests that XGBoost did not capture time-dependent patterns like seasonality and learnt past data too rigidly, leading to unreliable long-term forecasting. 


(2) CONCLUSION
    ----------
Statistical interpretation of Prophet's results:
- Low Errors: MAE (14.00) and RMSE (17.84) are less than 6% of the mean sales (~$300.20), demonstrating precision even with high volatility (std = 94.2).
- Business Impact: Errors of ~$14.00 to $17.84 are negligible for inventory planning, financial planning, etc. (even in the context of this project), given the sales range; i.e. minimum of $87.95 to maximum of $524.78).
- Optimization Insights:
	*Best Parameters: changepoint_prior_scale=10000, seasonality_mode='multiplicative', 'seasonality_prior_scale': 0.1 suggest strong trend flexibility and seasonality scaling.
	*Stability: Small gap between MAE and RMSE confirms no outlier dominance.

Despite XGBoost having superior numerical performance metrics, its failure to capture future trends raises concerns about its applicability to the project. Prophet, though slightly less precise, aligns well with historical trends, making it a more reliable choice for the project and dynamic sales environment in general as it is well known to adapt well to time series fluctuations (seasonal patterns, holidays, and special events) and unseen future trends.


(3) RECOMMENDATIONS
    ---------------
- A look into a hybrid model approach - Prophet + XGBoost to improve accuracy.
- Feature engineering enhancements - holidays, weekends, special events, and promotional periods as additional features for XGBoost. 
- More data - to allow the models to learn enough from history.
- Personally, I am considering learning the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model the soonest as it handles well Non-Linearity, Complex Dependencies and works well with High-Dimensional data such as Past sales (Lag Features), Holiday & Promotional Events, Competitor Pricing, unlike Prophet which focuses on Time Components alone and XGBoost, which treats time series as independent observations.
